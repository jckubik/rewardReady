# RewardReady


## Name
RewardReady

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.
Note: Just a brief description of the project. Can take this from 1st deliverable if you want.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
Note: Can delete if want, but you could also just describe some of the use cases for the web app

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
Either this or Authors and acknowledgment should remain, but not both

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
Note: add roadmap images for this

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.
Note: Just add group members and emails

## Project status - optional
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

If project status not filled in by time readme is done, then just delete
