# RewardReady

## Description
RewardReady is a web based application, with the intended purpose of providing latest deals and coupons to the user. The app works by having the registered users store information regarding the name and type of different credit or loyalty cards they currently own, their location and their favorite store. From this point, the app can be used by the user to maximize his rewards/additional savings when trying to purchase a product from a merchant. A user can also manually enter the product name/category to find the relevant deals/coupons. A user can also look through its shopping history to find the deals/coupons that he has previously used and would like to use again.
