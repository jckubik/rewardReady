# RewardReady

## Description
The RewardReady, a WebApp, works by having the registered users store information regarding the name and type of different credit or loyalty cards they currently own. From this point, the app can be used by the user to maximize his rewards/additional savings when trying to purchase a product from a merchant. A user can either manually enter the product name/category and merchant name or use the app to automatically detect the merchant based on his/her current geolocation. Based on the entered data, the app provides the user with information regarding the best card option to make the purchase from his/her bouquet of cards and other online deals/coupons available for the product/merchant (in general). The app also has an additional feature to recommend a new credit card user can apply for based on his previous searches to maximize his/her savings.  

These functionalities can also be availed by a unregistered user, however, to a limited extent. Recommendations provided by app for unregistered user are generic and not personalized (based on cards he/she holds).

## Usage

For a new user, the uasge of RewardReady is straightforward:

1) Create an account

2) Login to the app

3) Provide the details of different credit/loyalty cards held

From this point onward, the app is ready to provide user with personalized recommendations. User can deals/coupons from popular stores on his homepage. He/She can search for coupons or card recommendations by entering a store name manually or enabling the geolocation. In the latter case, the app itself finds the store name if there is actually an store at the geolocation of user.

An unregistered user can simply use the app to find deals and rewards by providing a store name or his/her current geolocation, without going through the logging in step. But as the app doesn't have information related to cards held by user in this case, the recommendations will be generic in nature (best card overall, disregard to whether user holds it or not).
